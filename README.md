# ServoControl

## üç¥ This is forked from the project at Little Wicket Railway to give more functionality to the ServoControl settings sketch. My thanks to Rob for the videos he done on model railway electronics on his YouTube channel that have enabled me to do this.

Contains files for use with the YouTube tutorials.
Visit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHAPXAcW9ZQ to see the step by step guide.

This script has been updated since the original video was uploaded to include the option
to change to a different servo without the need to change and upload the code for each one.

Servos can now all be wired up and while in situ using the <num>s command within the
serial monitor window change the pin you are calibrating.

Help screen has also been updated with more context help and examples.
  
This will now display a table of servo settings suitable for pasting into Servo.ino
