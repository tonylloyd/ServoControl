# ServoControl
Contains files for use with the YouTube tutorials.
Visit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHAPXAcW9ZQ to see the step by step guide.

This script has been updated since the original video was uploaded to include the option
to change to a different servo without the need to change and upload the code for each one.

Servos can now all be wired up and while in situ using the <num>s command within the
serial monitor window change the pin you are calibrating.

Help screen has also been updated with more context help and examples.
  
This will now display a table of servo settings suitable for pasting into Servo.ino
